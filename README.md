# Nuclear-Particle-Physics-Lab
Contains codes, data, plots, analysis and reports of PHY411 NPP Lab course.


The lab reports are given both here and inside the respective directories as well. Codes, plots and data are inside the directories.

## Tasks

A1 - Coin tosses and nuclear decays of unstable nuclei are simulated using pseudo-random numbers, and the results
are analysed.\
A2 - Muon Energy Loss\
A3 - Ionisation energy losses for 10 different particles through 10cm of copper is simulated and analysed. The
minimum energy loss for muons and electrons are calculated and plotted as a function of atomic number and
atomic mass.
